Assignment 1 Tokenizer: Read me

This assignment involves analyzing any string and being able to break down and interpret the string
in order to properly interpret and classify certain sequences of strings.  When intaking a string, the
program is intended to break down strings into words, decimal integers, octal integers, hexadecimal integers,
floating point, and various c operators.  The program needed to properly interpret blank spaces as
separations in tokens, as well as certain orders of charcters that would only be properly read as separate
tokens.  The program then outputs the name of the type of the word, as well as the string of characters 
that are encompassed by that particiular token.  Through this assignment, students were expected to 
increase their understanding and use of pointers, and allocations of memory in the C programming language.
